        I have recently obtained my degree in computer science from Queen Mary university of London. 
        I have been a full-time student for the past 5 years. Since college, I have been pursuing my 
        academic career in computing by studying btec level 3 extended diploma in IT (software development). 
        Throughout these years I have been a hard-working person and I have always accepted and overcame 
        new challenges

        l have developed a good foundation from my studies which includes critical thinking, analysing, and 
        solving technical problems in a logical manner. Other assets include being an active listener always 
        keen to be learning something new. I have had the aim of studying an aspect connected to computer 
        science from a young age. I undertook computer science degree as it contains aspects for all my 
        interests such as programming, networking, Artificial Intelligence, software development, electronics 
        engineering, game development and database systems etc. I have the passion to improve my understanding 
        in the computing/IT field because this is the digital age meaning that there are industries that 
        provide new and improved technology constantly; l want to be part of this.

        I've completed various projects during my time in university such as Implemented a third person speed-running, 
        action-adventure game that allows the player to race through levels set with multiple obstacles and puzzles. 
        This was created by using the tools MS Visual Studio and Unity with the programming language C#. In addition, 
        created an application used for elections campaigns to enable canvassers/tellers to differentiate voters from 
        non-voters (using real-data). This was created by using the tools Eclipse and MySQL Workbench with the programming 
        languages Java and SQL. Finally, developed an online newspaper web app using Django framework with HTML, CSS 
        JavaScript, and Python.
